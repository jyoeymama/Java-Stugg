# Java-Stugg
Welcome To: Java Stugg
This is all my random programs to help me better understand java.
If you are on this repository, please, do as you wish with any of my programs. I spend a lot of time trying to learn code in the hopes that maybe one day it might help someone.
If youd like to work with me and tell me anything, please email me at: jyomama28@gmail.com
You will recieve a response from my email in 1-2 days maximum. To anyone reading this, I truly thank you for stopping on my repo; it isnt much but I hope you like it :)
