            Welcome To: Java Stugg. This is all my random programs to help me better understand Java. If you are on this repository, please do as you wish with any of my programs. I spend a lot of time trying to learn code in the hopes that maybe one day it might help someone. If you’d like to work with me and tell me anything, please email me at: jyomama28@gmail.com. You will receive a response from my email in 1-2 days maximum. To anyone reading this, I truly thank you for stopping on my repo; it isn’t much, but I hope you like it. I have been working hard on it :)
